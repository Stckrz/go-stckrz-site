So for a couple of days now, I've been really hunkering down on trying to learn Java and Spring Boot etc.. This is because I have a job interview coming up under that stack. This means I have had less time for this project, which is kind of sad, but on the other hand, if I do well, I could finally have a good job. Don't worry, as soon as that happens, most of my free time will be back into learning Go and Javascript, as my heart really is there right now.. If I don't get the job, I don't know what I'm going to do, it's so rare that I am able to find interviews and opportunities, and this one really is the best shot I've ever had at getting a good tech job.

So yeah, if you've wondered where I've been, it's mostly because I've been learning the ins and outs of Java api's, as well as brushing up on some general interview questions etc..
