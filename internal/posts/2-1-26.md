I know, it's been forever again since I've made a post, I'm sorry.. I'll really try to be better about it. To be honest, a lot of my time has been spent organizing my life and getting everything together, all I need to do is set up a time, ideally at least weekly, to make a little blog post in here. Work takes a lot of my time as well, but my organizational skills have been improving pretty dramatically, giving me more time, I think, it general. 

I've been working as hard as I can to really pick up at work and learn a lot.. Although I still feel like I don't know as much as I should, I've probably learned more in the few months that I've been there, than I have in my entire dev history. 

Aside from that, I've been working on a suite of microservices for "gambling". Most of this work has been backend so far, but I'd like to be able to have integrations across discord, several web apps, and whatever else I want, for people to  be able to play games and win tokens, that they can then go ahead and spend on "prizes" of some kind. The backend is coming along quite nicely, and is even deployed on the cluster!

Not much more to talk about right now.. but I swear I'm going to start blogging more on here.
