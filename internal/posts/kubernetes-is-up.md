So, yesterday, I finally got around to setting up the Kubernetes cluster! It's not completely done, and currently only has Longhorn running, but soon! Once I set up the ingress and get cloudflare up and running, and probably rancher, I'll be able to host this, and people can finally see it! Idk how I will find any traffic but yeah. I still need to figure out how to mature the site, I cant think of many reasons people would use this site now, other than to read my blogs, which is tremendously boring. I'm not sure what I'll do on here, I could have tutorials, maybe some little games or something.. OOH! I also need to set up self-hosting for an S3 bucket so I can have reliable images, too. Anyways, that's about it for now!
