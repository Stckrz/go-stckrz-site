As I mentioned in the past, I want to kind of make my own versions of a lot of the common indie-web tools myself. Since yesterday I've been kind of working on my own system for a simple guestbook. This is using a separate api microservice in go. I felt this was a good simple project, because I don't have to worry as much about over-engineering it, even though I probably will anyways.. Really, all of the information for a guestbook is public. I only really need to worry about the post request endpoint, and possibly some rate limiting in case somebody likes to mess around.

Jeez, I hope I get someone to actually sign up to my guestlist haha.. It's still so early, I cant peep the vision, of people actually visiting my site. I still have to figure out how to bring value.. Simlpy a blog has limited value to most people I think, and it'd be nice to be able to maybe offer tools other people could use, or something that would make my page fun or cool :)
