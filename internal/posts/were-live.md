We are finally live! I know it's been forever since an update.. That's because I finallyyy got a job, and I've been really busy trying to settle in. Yesterday, we got the Kubernetes cluster fixed finally, and this blog was the first thing I wanted to figure out and deploy. It's got automatic build and deploy on merge and all sorts of things. I do NOT have the guestbook added in yet, that'll have to be a separate deployment for a later time, and I've gotten a lot better since I wrote it, so I might want to sort of re-write it at some point..

In any case, I'm so glad to finally have the blog up and running :) And I have SO SO much more planned with the cluster - right now I have a whole suite of microservices planned that I'm working on for a relatively large project. More on that later, though.
