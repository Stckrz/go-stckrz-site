So I had an initial interview, and I have my next interview confirmed, and soon-to-be-scheduled. Sadly, this means that for the time being, I cant really dig into the kubernetes or this project too much.. but soon! I promise! Either I get the job, then all of my free time can go to whatever I want AND the money to build up the cluster, or I don't, and I can spend as much time with the cluster as i want to. Either way, it's a win-win for the cluster :) Unfortunately for right now though, basically all of my time that I can afford needs to be tethered to studying for a technical interview that includes hackerrank questions, basic questions, etc.. Wish me luck! <3
