Hello again! I promised I'd write more, so here I am.. It's been an interesting couple of days at work.. things have sort of been picking up :) I'm still learning a lot, so that's great. I've been falling off of the gambling project, in lieu of a new project I'm working on. Basically, an interface for what I call "The Village". The idea is a metaphorical village, where each building represents an aspect of my life. The entire village is a personal economy, and the money and attention flows through them all. The idea is to try to create a level of balance, and equilibrium between these different aspects.

The project, will basically be a set of todo's for each building, and will keep track on a monthly basis, of what buildings I'm accomplishing more on, and which maybe need a little bit more love. It'll show statistics for this over time, etc.. all that fun stuff. It'll be a bit until it's done, because I want to do all the art myself.

Aside from that, I'm really digging into Kubernetes. I am soon to move over my home assistant. I'm also buying another computer for a set top box, since I can't seem to find any device that isn't completely ad-ridden *rolls eyes into my skull*..

Anyways, I think that's basically all for now :) Pleasure chatting, as always.
