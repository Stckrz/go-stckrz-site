It's been days still, of interview prep. I'm getting better at hackerrank prep, BUT I'm also getting antsy. Like, I have so many cool things that I want to work on @,@.. It's okay, I just have to remind myself that if I do well, that I will have a lot more time and resources to do cool things that I want to do. That will make all of this worth it :). I really really need this to work out, I'm running on E in terms of health, etc.. so.. wish me a hope!
