Still kind of figuring out exactly how I want this whole thing to work.. I think I want to kind of strike a balance between a more modern aesthetic, while still maintaining some of the themes of indie-web and older websites.. This means having a more modern, sleeker design. This also means having things like webring links, buttons, and other fun things.. Maybe even a webgarden or something.

It's still going to be a little bit before it is live, because I kind of want to wait until I have Kubernetes set up at home, with my own S3 bucket so I can handle images etc.. The idea is to have an automation where whenever I add a new markdown file here, it will auto-build, update the repo, and then github can automatically pull the new build and deploy.. This way, development and updates should be very fast and easy for me, hopefully making it so that I kind of keep up with it, no matter how fast-paced everything else gets.

I know how crazy it is to say "oh let me get kubernetes set up so it can be really easy", but kubernetes is actually so good and easy to maintain, once you have it set up.
